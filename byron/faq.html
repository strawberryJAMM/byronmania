            <dt><strong> <span class="hilite-big">Q: <a name="Homosexual">Was 
              Byron homosexual?</a></span></strong></dt>
            <dd> 
              <p><strong> <span class="hilite-big">A: </span></strong> Yes, and 
                no. One of Byron's college friends, Charles Matthews, along with 
                all things liberal and fashionable, advocated &quot;paederasty&quot; 
                in the classic Greek tradition. </p>
              <p>In a letter to a friend in 1809, Byron wrote (probably facetiously) 
                that he was going to Turkey to do research for a treatise &quot;Sodomy 
                simplified or Paederasty proved to be praiseworthy from ancient 
                authors and modern practice&quot;. Like all jokes, this must have 
                had an edge of truth to be funny. </p>
              <p>At Cambridge, Byron had fallen deeply in love with a choirboy, 
                John Edelston. Byron wrote several poems that scholars believe 
                were written to and about John, calling him &quot;Thyrza&quot;. 
                One of the Thyrza poems, written after John had died, indicates 
                in the words: &quot;The pressure of the thrilling hand, the kiss, 
                so guiltless and refined, that Love each warmer wish forbore&quot;, 
                that their physical contact had been restricted to hand-holding 
                and kissing. He later referred to it as a passion &quot;violent 
                though pure&quot;. Even much later in life, after the &quot;Thyrza&quot; 
                poems had become very famous and popular, Byron refused to say 
                who they were addressed to and changed the pronouns from masculine 
                to feminine to conceal that this doomed but lifelong passion was 
                for a man. </p>
              <p>After two years of being Byron's &quot;<u>almost</u> <u>constant</u> 
                associate since October 1805&quot;, John had to move away from 
                Cambridge to London and Byron wrote to a woman friend, Elizabeth 
                Pigot, about his heartbreak, saying that he was planning to live 
                with his &quot;prot&eacute;g&eacute;&quot; after he had completed 
                his studies, which would &quot;put Lady E. Butler &amp; Miss Ponsonby 
                to the <u>Blush</u>, <u>Pylades</u> &amp; <u>Orestes</u> out of 
                countenance, &amp; want nothing but a <u>Catastrophe</u> like 
                <u>Nisus</u> and <u>Euryalus</u>, to give <u>Johnathon</u> &amp; 
                <u>David</u> the 'go by' &quot;. These are all same-sex passionate 
                relationships.</p>
              <p>However, some time later John wrote a very courteous and formal 
                letter to Byron asking for his help in getting a job. They had 
                never met again.</p>
              <p>While Byron was on his travels in Turkey, Albania, and Greece 
                he wrote to Matthews frequently about his sexual conquests of 
                boys using a coded term based on Latin &quot;plen. et optabil. 
                &#150;Coit.&quot; (Frequent and desired intercourse). He reported 
                that he was amusing himself with &quot;a Sopha to tumble upon&quot; 
                with a Greek boy called Eustathius who had &quot;ambrosial curls 
                hanging down his amiable back&quot;.</p>
              <p>It has been argued (with very little evidence)that while in the 
                East, Byron was a lover of Ali Pasha or his son, Veli Pasha, rulers 
                of Albania and the Peloponessus. They were very friendly and hospitable 
                to Byron and Veli Pasha did give him a beautiful white horse.</p>
              <p>Byron's relationships with friends of both sexes seem to have 
                been shadowed by jealousy and possessiveness. John Cam Hobhouse 
                considered himself to be Byron's &quot;best friend&quot; and in 
                many ways was, travelling with him, assisting him legally and 
                financially and finally burying him. There is no trace of sexuality 
                between them.</p>
              <p>Byron and Shelley became very close friends in the summer of 
                1816 in Switzerland. They sailed around Lake Leman together visiting 
                the locations of a romantic novel written by Rousseau called &quot;La 
                Nouvelle Heloise&quot;. One afternoon they exchanged roses. This 
                was rhapsodically memorialized by Shelley in his journal where 
                he referred to Byron, anonymously, as &quot;my companion&quot;.</p>
              <p>While he was visiting Byron in Venice several years later, Shelley 
                was shocked by Byron's ostentatiously erotic lifestyle and remarked 
                in a letter to a friend in England that some of his street pick-ups 
                had &quot;lost the gait and physiognomy of men&quot;. This has 
                been interpreted to mean they were cross-dressers. Shelley was 
                also outraged that Byron bargained with parents for the services 
                of their daughters.</p>
              <p>The last poems Byron wrote were found among his papers after 
                his sudden death. They indicated that he had fallen painfully 
                and guiltily in love with a fifteen year old Greek boy named Loukas 
                Chalandritsanos. Byron gave him money, fancy uniforms and the 
                command of a regiment. As far as is known there was no physical 
                contact between them.</p>
              <p>Byron is known to have had sex with at least 300 women.</p>
              <p>So the verdict is bisexual, although such distinctions were not 
                explicit at the time. I think &quot;hyper-sexual&quot; covers 
                it. </p>

<dt><strong> <span class="hilite-big">Q: <a name="Incest">Did he have sex with
his sister?</a></span></strong></dt>
<dd> <p><strong> <span class="hilite-big">A: </span></strong> To begin with,
Augusta was his half sister and they had met only a few times before they were
adults.</p>
<p>There was a mysterious, and not yet truly identified, lover in the summer of
1813 who gave Byron cause for guilt and worry. He wrote about this relationship
in letters to Lady Melbourne, an older woman confidante, and to Thomas Moore, a
fellow poet and companion &quot;man-about-town&quot;. </p>
<p>Few things worried Byron who was a Lord, a legislator, a satirist and a
crack shot. He implied in his letters that if this relationship was publicly
admitted it would be so socially unacceptable that he and Lady Melbourne would
have to discontinue their friendship and correspondence, although, in most
circumstances, he did not really care about &quot;society&quot; or what it
considered acceptable behaviour. He continued to refer to this problem in
letters for over a year - until late in 1814.</p>
<p>During a holiday spent at the Byron family mansion, Newstead Abbey, near
Nottingham, Byron and Augusta carved their names in the bark of a tree - a
singularly romantic action, but not irrefutable evidence for carnal connection.
</p>
<p>Augusta had been appointed one of the elderly Queen Charlotte's ladies in
waiting and had moved to an apartment in St James's Palace. If the court had
any idea that she was less than an exemplary wife, this appointment would
certainly have been cancelled. </p>
<p>Byron's wife, Annabella, exonerated herself for having walked out on him
after a year of marriage on the grounds that she believed that he had slept
with Augusta.</p>
<p>Many researchers in the 20th Century (particularly Malcolm Elwin and Doris
Langley Moore) have examined the documents and are not convinced.</p>
<p>A scandalous book was published in the 1860's by Harriet Beecher Stowe (the
Uncle Tom's Cabin lady) revealing the incest to the world as
&quot;vindication&quot; for Lady Byron.</p>
<p>Much of the documented evidence was collected by his grandson, Lord
Wentworth, in the 1880's and published in 1921 as &quot;Astarte&quot; - the
name of the incestuous lover in Byron's poem &quot;Manfred&quot; which has been
assumed to be biographical.</p>
<p>Salacious gossip that continued to swirl around his wife and family included
other problems - bigamy, homosexuality and marital sodomy. Incest may have been
seen as a more socially acceptable sin.</p>
<p>Byron had sex with anyone who wanted him. If Augusta wanted it, I'm sure he
obliged.</p>
<p>So the verdict is - maybe.</p>

<dt><strong> <span class="hilite-big">Q: <a name="Medora">Was Medora Leigh
Byron's illegitimate daughter?</a></span></strong></dt>
<dd> 
              <p><strong> <span class="hilite-big">A: </span></strong> Augusta 
                Mary Byron Leigh, was the wife of her cousin, Colonel George Leigh. 
                She was Byron's older half sister, as her mother had died and 
                their father remarried. Her husband's mother, Frances Byron Leigh 
                had been very close to her brother, Jack Byron, the poet's father. 
                It has been argued that they had had an earlier incestuous relationship, 
                but it is unlikely that Byron, his sister or her husband knew 
                about it, if it had occurred. George Leigh may have been a half-brother 
                also!!!!</p>
<p>The poet's mother, however, who raised him in Scotland, had very little
contact with the Byrons until her son inherited the Barony in 1798. Augusta,
orphaned in 1791, was brought up by her mother's family and did not really meet
Byron until they were both adults. </p>
<p>He corresponded with her on very affectionate terms when he was a teenager
until he asked her to co-sign a loan to cover his extravagant lifestyle. She
refused, and he became very angry with her.</p>
<p>In 1813, he was a feted and famous poet. Augusta's husband was in serious
financial difficulties as he had been caught skimming money from sales of the
horses of his patron, the Prince of Wales and, disgraced, had lost almost
everything. </p>
<p>Byron visited her at her country house and when he returned to London, she
came with him. He told a friend in a letter that his sister was going to travel
with him to Europe. He later added that she planned to bring one of her
children. They didn't go, because plague had broken out and they decided the
trip would be too dangerous. This has been seen as an aborted elopement. </p>
<p>Augusta became pregnant that summer, and she spent Christmas of 1813 with
Byron, at the Byron family mansion, Newstead Abbey, in Nottinghamshire. She had
never been there before. Her other children were there, too, but not her
husband.</p>
<p>Byron said he loved her because she was his closest relative and because she
made him laugh. Later in the year, they carved their names in a tree on the
grounds.</p>
<p>The child was born in April 1814 and named Medora, the name of the heroine
in one of Byron's most popular poems, &quot;The Corsair&quot;.</p>
<p>Byron never showed any special affection for Medora, and she was known to
the family by her first name, Libby (Elizabeth). In fact, he favoured her older
sister, Georgy (Georgiana).</p>
<p>So - I think only DNA testing would solve this one. I'd like to start a fund
to finance the test.</p>

<dt><strong> <span class="hilite-big">Q: <a name="Pronunciation"> How do you
pronounce his name?</a></span></strong></dt>
<dd> 
              <p><strong> <span class="hilite-big">A: </span></strong> He wrote 
                it many ways, and apparently pronounced it differently from time 
                to time. He wrote it B-Y-R-O-N and B-I-R-O-N (which is the French 
                spelling) and in Greek letters <span class="greek"><font face="symbol">m-p-a-i-r-o-n</font></span> 
                (mu-pi-alpha-iota-rho-omicron-nu). It was reported by people who 
                knew him that he called his wife &quot;Lady B'rn&quot;, and that 
                he was spoken about as &quot;B'rn&quot;. However, the Greek spelling 
                Alpha Iota would indicate that the vowel was clearly pronounced 
                as /a<sub>y</sub>/. In writing to Augusta he reported that his 
                daughter Allegra, &quot;was a true Byron&quot; because she couldn't 
                pronounce her &quot;R's&quot;. This would slur the pronunciation 
                of the vowel and the consonant in their name. It was also reported 
                that he changed the pronunciation to emphasize the vowel sound 
                when he lived in Italy - which would have made it more difficult 
                for the Italians. He wrote that at the beginning of their relationship, 
                his Italian lover, Teresa Guiccioli, embarrassed him by calling 
                &quot;mio Biron&quot; across a crowded room. She had not yet, 
                apparently learned to say &quot;B<u>y</u>ron&quot;.</p>

<dt><strong> <span class="hilite-big">Q: <a name="Name">What <u>is</u> his
name?</a></span></strong></dt>
<dd> <p><strong> <span class="hilite-big">A: </span></strong> He was born
January 22, 1788, the son of Captain John (Mad Jack) Byron and Catherine
(Kitty) Gordon, Laird of Ghigt (a Scottish title). His paternal grandparents
were Admiral John Byron and Sophia Trevanion Byron and his maternal grandfather
was George Gordon, Laird of Ghigt. He was christened George Gordon Byron.</p>
<p>He grew up in Aberdeen, Scotland, but by then his mother was no longer Laird
of Ghigt, as she had sold her land and title to pay his father's debts. His
father left them and died in France. He was registered at school as George
Byron Gordon. Neighbours called him &quot;wee Geordie Byron&quot; and &quot;the
leetle deevil&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1798, he inherited lands and title as Lord Byron, with the estate of
Newstead Abbey in Nottingham and Baron Byron of Rochdale in Lancashire. A
confusion arises because his title and surname are the same. </p>
<p>He was addressed as The Right Honourable Lord Byron (by strangers and on the
outside of letters) and as Byron (the title, not the name) by friends.
Intimates seem to have actually called him &quot;B&quot;, but this may just be
the convention of the time to abbreviate names to initials in writing, but
possibly not in fact. Servants would have said &quot;My Lord&quot; but an
intimately beloved housemaid, Susan Vaughn, addressed her letters to &quot;My
Dearest Friend&quot; and his wife addressed a letter to him, &quot;My Dearest
Duck&quot;.</p>
<p>When his mother-in-law died, a stipulation of her will was that, in order to
inherit, her beneficiaries must take her family name. Byron added it to his and
became George Gordon Noel Byron in 1822. He also added it to his signature.</p>
<p>So - George Gordon (Noel) Byron, Lord Byron, Sixth Baron Byron of Rochdale.
No-one ever called him George after he became Byron - not even his mother. He
is not Lord George Gordon Byron as this designates the younger brother of a
Lord (like Lord John Russell). Is that clear?</p>

                sex from the time he was nine years old (he started with his nursemaid). 
                He was notorious during his lifetime as a bisexual erotic athlete. 
                It was said that he always carried a condom in his pocket - just 
                in case. (He bought condoms by the dozen and had very few illegitimate 
                children and no venereal disease as an adult). He set up a mistress 
                in a house in Brompton when he was seventeen. He reported &quot;having&quot; 
                more than 200 women one year when he was living in Venice. He 
                wrote sly and suggestive poetry that shocked his friends and that 
                his publisher refused to print. He was thirty six when he died.</p>

                story of Hero and Leander. He swam it on May 3rd 1810, from &quot;Sestos 
                to Abydos&quot; and wrote a funny poem about it. He was very proud 
                of this - long distance swimming was his favourite sport. He swam 
                across the mouth of the Tagus River at Lisbon and from the Lido 
                to the Rialto Bridge in Venice. This swim took four hours and

                who were in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire. He was in Missolonghi, 
                planning the first raid to be organized with British help, in 
                the spring of 1824. On April 19, he died of a fever that was probably 
                a relapse of the malaria that he had contracted in 1811. The fever 
                had come on as a complication of a cold after going riding in 
                a rain storm. He is reported to have claimed to his valet that 
                his doctors were assassinating him. He did not approve of bleeding 
                as a treatment for fever, but after several days of illness, he 
                became very weak and permitted the doctors to bleed him. They 
                drew his blood repeatedly, until it ran clear, which pleased them, 
                as they feared permanent brain damage from fever. They had also 
                repeatedly purged him. After he fell into a coma, they were not 
                able to give him water which he had been frequently demanding 
                before he lost consciousness. He died a day later. He was thirty-six.</p>
