<div class="biography">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The baby boy who was later to become the notorious
&quot;lover, lunatic and poet&quot;, Lord Byron, sixth Baron Byron, was born in
1788 in lodgings in London. His mother, alone during the last months of her
pregnancy because her husband was in France, had been writing pathetic letters
to lawyers asking for financial assistance, so she could buy food, a place to
live and medical care. This was ironic as she was a Scottish noblewoman,
Catherine Gordon, Laird of Ghigt, a descendant of the King of Scotland. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not known why she was in London. Her father-in-law,
<a href="../resources/images/b-grandfather.gif">John Byron</a>, had been an admiral and
her mother-in-law, <a href="../resources/images/b-grandmother.gif">Sophia Trevanion
Byron,</a> was one of Dr. Johnson's literary ladies. Although Sophia Byron was
living in London, there is no record of her having met Catherine or her infant
grandson.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The baby, named George Gordon Byron after his mother's
father, was born with a caul over his head and a misshapen foot.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Byron soon moved back to her own family in Scotland
where she raised her son in &quot;reduced circumstances&quot;. Her charming,
handsome but disreputable husband, who had finished squandering her
considerable fortune, had abandoned them and died in misery and poverty in
France.</p>

vspace="0" hspace="20" width="100" height="100"></a></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="../resources/images/little-boy.gif">The little boy</a>,
active and mischievous, grew up in Aberdeen where these years of his childhood
were the happiest of his life and were always remembered with nostalgia.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Even as a child he was marked for Love: at seven years old
he experienced a &quot;passion&quot; for his cousin, Mary Duff, and his
nursemaid &quot;took liberties with his person&quot; introducing him, at the
age of nine, to sexual play.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When he was ten, in 1798, Byron inherited an English Barony
from an elderly Great Uncle and became the Lord of a mismanaged and decrepit
manor entangled in rumour, superstition and litigation.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">The house, <a href="../resources/images/newstead.gif">Newstead Abbey</a>, 
            built in the ruins of an Augustinian priory three hundred years before, 
            was practically uninhabitable, but arcane and evocative to a precocious, 
            intelligent boy fascinated by history. His practical and efficient 
            mother began to restore the house to liveability and the estate to 
            profitability. </p>
<p><a href="../resources/images/byron-13.gif"><img

vspace="0" hspace="20" width="150" height="188"></a></p>
<p><a href="../resources/images/byron-13.gif">The boy Baron</a>, used to the freedom and
egalitarianism he had know as a Scottish schoolboy, resented the aristocratic
distance expected of an English Peer. In an early poem he wrote: </p>
<blockquote> <p>Fortune take back these cultured lands,<br>
Take back this name of splendid sound!<br>
I hate the touch of servile hands,<br>
I hate the slaves that cringe around.<br>
Place me among the rocks I love,<br>
Which sound to Ocean's wildest roar. <br>
I ask but this &#151; again to rove <br>
Through scenes my youth hath known before. <a href="#1"><font
size="-1"><sup>i</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Byron, &#151; and the nursemaid &#151; lived in a grim house
in Nottingham which still stands at the top of St. James Street, close to the
hospital where Byron was being treated to correct the problem with his foot.
They were also close to several Byron family aunts and cousins. Once Newstead
was comfortable, Mrs. Byron leased it to Lord Grey de Ruthyn, a
&quot;sporting&quot; young man of twenty two who was &quot;mad&quot; for
hunting. She took a charming house, Burgage Manor, in Southwell, a small and
pleasant town twelve miles from the estate. This house, also, is still there. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Byron was sent to school at Harrow, where he made
friendships &quot;too romantic to last&quot; by defending younger boys from
bullies. At home on holidays, he also befriended other young people who lived
in the vicinity of Newstead . He always fell in love &#151; and lust &#151;
very easily, and felt rejection very keenly.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/charismatic.gif"><img
src="../resources/images/charismatic-thumb.gif" alt="Charismatic" align="LEFT" border="0"
vspace="0" hspace="20" width="113" height="150"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">His later adolescence was bedevilled by the power of his <a href="../resources/images/charismatic.gif">charismatic 
            good looks</a> and irresistible sexual charm. At Christmas, Byron 
            was a guest of Lord Grey (in his own house) until something occurred 
            that created a &quot;shyness&quot; between them. This was probably 
            further sexual experimentation &#151; of a very exotic sort. He inspired 
            jealousy in both men and women while enjoying physical pleasures with 
            schoolboy friends, harlots, household servants and social climbing 
            young women of &quot;quality&quot;.<br clear="all">
</p>
          <p align="justify">He began to write light-hearted and self-depreciating poetry 
            inspired by his painful loves and erotic escapades. </p>
<blockquote> <p>Woman! experience might have told me<br>
That all must love thee that behold thee:<br>
Surely experience must have taught<br>
Thy firmest promises are but nought <a href="#2"><font
size="-1"><sup>ii</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>Why should you weep like Lydia Languish,<br>
And fret with self-created anguish?<br>
Or doom the lover you have chosen<br>
On winter nights to sigh half frozen;<br>
In leafless shades to sue for pardon<br>
Only because the scene's a garden?<br>
. . . <br>
In Italy I've no objection;<br>
Warm nights are proper for reflection;<br>
But here our climate is so rigid<br>
That love itself is rather frigid:<br>
. . . <br>
Then let us meet as oft we've done<br>
Beneath the influence of the sun<br>
Or if at midnight I must meet you<br>
Within your boudoir let me greet you<br>
There we can love for hours together<br>
Much better in such snowy weather<br>
. . .<br>
Then if my passion fail to please<br>
Next night I'll be content to freeze <a href="#3"><font

<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>In law an infant, and in years a boy,<br>
In mind a slave to every vicious joy;<br>
From every sense of shame and virtue wean'd<br>
In lies an adept, in deceit a fiend;<br>
Versed in hypocrisy, while yet a child;<br>
Fickle as wind, of inclinations wild;<br>
Woman his dupe, his heedless friend a tool;<br>
Old in the world though scarcely broke from school <a href="#4"><font
size="-1"><sup>iv</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">He published a book of his poetry, in 1807, at the age of
nineteen, as <em>Hours of Idleness</em>. </p>

</p>
<p align="justify">In his second year at Cambridge, as a published author, he
was accepted into a group of older, influential scholars, many of whom remained
his closest friends for life. At Cambridge, also, he had become entranced by
the beautiful face and angelic singing voice of a choirboy, John Edelston, and
fell painfully and somewhat guiltily <a href="../resources/images/caravaggio-amor.gif">in
love</a> with him. </p>
<blockquote> <p>There be none of Beauty's daughters<br>

And like music on the waters<br>
<spacer size="15">Is thy sweet voice to me <a href="#5"><font
size="-1"><sup>v</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">He was reconciled to this &quot;paederasty&quot; by one of
his new friends, Charles Matthews, who was known as &quot;Citoyen&quot; for his
radical ideas, sympathetic to the French Revolution. </p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/byron-raphael.gif"><img
src="../resources/images/byron-raphael-thumb.gif" alt="Byron" align="LEFT" border="0"
vspace="0" hspace="20" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p align="justify">With Matthews, <a href="../resources/images/hobby.gif">John Cam
Hobhouse</a>, founder of the Cambridge Whig club and Scrope Davies, a perpetual
and successful gambler, <a href="../resources/images/byron-raphael.gif">Byron</a> ,
handsome, fashionable and convivial, submerged himself in a life of
dissipation. He went up to London and took up sponsorship of prize fights,
dinners with &quot;bawds and ballet masters&quot; and ordered &#163;500 worth
of wine &#151; when, in Scotland, he and his mother had lived on &#163;150 a
year .<br clear="all">
</p>
<p align="justify">His first book of poetry having been mercilessly criticized
in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, in 1809, at twenty one, Byron took revenge by
publishing <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em>, a scathing satire on
the currently popular poets and critics. This made his name as a poet.</p>
<p><a href="../resources/images/byron-and-robert.gif"><img

border="0" vspace="0" hspace="20" width="100" height="112"></a></p>
<p align="justify">After running up further enormous debts by purchasing the
freedom of a mistress from her bordello, driving around in a coach and four and
redecorating his ancestral home with expensive wallpaper, elaborate draperies,
ornate furniture and a <a href="../resources/images/byron-and-robert.gif">life size
portrait of himself</a>, he left on a journey to the exotic and erotic
countries of the east.</p>
          <p align="justify"> Although the Napoleonic war was at it's height, 
            he rode through Portugal and Spain wearing a military uniform while 
            his servants travelled to Gibraltar by sea. In later years, Byron's 
            travelling companion, John Cam Hobhouse, acted as a military courier 
            and diplomat. They may have been combining a diplomatic or military 
            mission with their tourism.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/souvenir-costume.gif"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">Byron spent the next two years in Greece, Turkey and Albania, 
            collecting <a href="../resources/images/souvenir-costume.gif">souvenir costumes</a> 
            and once more, possibly, acting in a diplomatic capacity in visits 
            to Ali Pasha and his son Veli Pasha, Turkish rulers in Albania and 
            southern Greece. At one point he and Hobhouse took command of a captured 
            Turkish vessel and became privateers. Byron's favourite sport was 
            long distance swimming. He was very proud of having swum the Hellespont 
            in imitation of Leander's mythic feat.</p>

<p align="justify"></p>
          <p align="justify">After Hobhouse returned to England, Byron stayed on in Greece, 
            living in a boy's residential school and once more enjoying the physical 
            pleasures indulged in by early adolescent school mates. He also travelled 
            throughout the Peloponnesus and Greek Islands, once in company with 
            a &quot;talented&quot; boy who wore long curls and carried a parasol. 
            He began writing a long poem in the style of a Medieval romance called 
            <em>Childe Burun's Pilgrimage</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">He did not report falling in love there, but one of the boys
&#151; Nicolo Giraud &#151; became his constant companion, riding down to swim
together every day at Piraeus. He saved Byron's life by nursing him through a
serious fever which was probably his first bout of malaria. Later Byron paid
for Nicolo's education in a monastery on Malta and provided a large legacy for
him in his will of 1811. Byron's love for boys always had a strong element of
paternal responsibility.</p>
<p align="justify">Returning to England in late summer, 1811, completely
without funds, he never again saw his mother as she died suddenly at Newstead.
Within a few weeks he was crushed by grief. John Edelston, his beloved
<a href="../resources/images/caravaggio-rest.gif">choirboy</a> had died while he was
away.</p>

<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">At Christmas time, 1811, Byron invited friends to Newstead
Abbey, attempting to &quot;banish care&quot; by re-creating the days when he
and his college cronies dressed up in monks robes, drank from a silver cup made
from a skull and chased the housemaids. Boringly, they read, talked and
studied.</p>
<p align="justify">Byron fell in love with a &quot;decorative and pliant&quot;,
Welsh housemaid named Susan Vaughn. She, presumably not believing he truly
loved her, entertained other men in Byron's absence and became involved in
jealous intrigues. He &quot;sent her home to her family&quot;, but she broke
his heart.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/westall-1813.gif"><img
src="../resources/images/westall-1813-thumb.gif" alt="Byron, by Westall" align="LEFT"
border="0" vspace="0" hspace="20" width="170" height="241"></a></p>
<p align="justify">In March 1812 the long poem he had begun in Greece was
released, renamed <em> Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</em>. He said &quot;I woke up
one day and found myself famous&quot;. Handsome, charming and with a reputation
for wickedness, he was <a href="../resources/images/westall-1813.gif">the star</a> of
London's social season of spring 1812.</p>
<p align="justify">Byron and the waltz became the fashion of the drawing rooms
of London at the same time. Because of his twisted foot, he stood apart from
the dance, apparently brooding darkly in depreciation of the frivolities of
society. This enhanced his melancholic reputation &#151; and his sexual
attractiveness.<br clear="all">
</p>
          <p align="justify">An emotional and eccentric older married woman, <a href="../resources/images/caroline.gif">Lady 
            Caroline Lamb</a>, became infatuated with him. At first he was flattered 
            and responded to her with abandon. Byron liked to collect &quot;locks&quot; 
            of hair as mementoes of his loves. Caroline sent him one &#151; of 
            pubic hair &#151; with a warning to be careful of the scissors points 
            if he attempted to duplicate the compliment. She didn't want any damage 
            done to the essential equipment of a lover. He confided his sexual 
            experiences and preferences to her. She came to his rooms, and had 
            a portrait painted, dressed as a boy in a page's uniform.</p>
<p align="justify">Her family became increasingly embarrassed by Caroline's
behaviour. Her husband, William Lamb, was a politician. As they were afraid
that they might elope together, her mother-in-law,
<a href="../resources/images/lady-m.gif">Lady Melbourne</a>, befriended Byron and
convinced him to break off the relationship. Her family whisked Caroline off to
their estate in Ireland.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/charlotte.gif"><img
src="../resources/images/charlotte-thumb.gif" alt="Princess Charlotte" align="RIGHT"
border="0" vspace="0" hspace="20" width="109" height="134"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Byron consoled himself by becoming the live-in lover of
<a href="../resources/images/lady-o.gif">Lady Oxford</a>. She was twice his age but years
later he wrote that &quot;her autumnal charms&quot; were among the finest he
had ever enjoyed. Lady Oxford was a friend of Caroline the Princess of Wales,
and Byron became part of her society. There he met her daughter, the Heir to
the throne, <a href="../resources/images/charlotte.gif">Princess Charlotte</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">In the summer of 1813 Byron fell into a passion which
seriously affected his life. There was something forbidden and dangerous about
it. He confided his love in letters to Lady Melbourne, who was alarmed for him.
Most biographers, following the evidence compiled by Byron's wife and grandson,
accept that he had a love affair with his half-sister
<a href="../resources/images/augusta.gif">Mrs. Augusta Leigh</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">Lady Caroline Lamb returned from Ireland and continued to
write to him, go to his home and threaten him. At an evening party, after
becoming angry with Byron, she cut her hand. This was reported in the papers as
an attempted suicide. Today, her behaviour would be considered as stalking
&#151; a crime. Once, in his rooms when he was absent, she wrote &quot;Remember
me&quot; on the fly leaf of a book. The book was <em>Vathek</em> a novel
written by a man who had been convicted of sodomy. Byron's response was a poem:
</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>Remember thee! remember thee!<br>
Till Lethe quench life's burning stream<br>
Remorse and shame shall cling to thee<br>
And haunt thee like a feverish dream<br>
<br>
Remember thee! Aye doubt it not.<br>
Thy husband too shall think of thee!<br>
By neither shalt thou be forgot,<br>
Thou<u> false</u> to him thou <u>fiend</u> to me! <a href="#9"><font
size="-1"><sup>ix</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Caroline continued to follow him and spy on him for years,
trying to guess who his new &quot;attachments&quot; could be &#151; and
spreading gossip in order to embarrass him and possibly destroy his
relationships. </p>
<p align="justify">In January 1815, Byron married
<a href="../resources/images/annabella.gif">Anne Isabella Milbanke</a>, known as
Annabella. She was a staid, portentous, analytical young woman who had read too
many &quot;Gothic&quot; novels and fancied herself as a
&quot;disinterested&quot; heroine, sacrificing herself for Love. She intended
to redeem Byron from his life of wickedness by the good example of her
Undeviating Rectitude.</p>
<p align="justify">She was, undoubtedly, interesting and intelligent. She wrote
poetry and had been patroness to a poet, which was why Byron had first become
attracted to her. He called her the &quot;Princess of Parallelograms&quot;
&#151; referring to her reputation as a mathematician. As she was completely
unable to ever understand, or take interest in, the serious financial problems
faced by her parents and her husband, her mathematics must have been
exclusively theoretical.</p>
<p align="justify">The sale of Newstead Abbey was supposed to provide the funds
to cancel Byron's debts and to support the marriage, but the purchaser
defaulted.</p>
<p align="justify">Annabella was passionate, but prudish. She was, also, madly
jealous. As they were hopelessly mismatched, the marriage was painful right
from the start. Annabella did not like it when Byron &quot;versified,&quot; as
she put it, because she resented his need for private contemplation. Their
financial situation became so difficult that the bailiffs moved into their
London house to prevent them from removing the furniture.</p>
<p align="justify"> In the evenings, he escaped his domestic troubles by
immersing himself in the theatrical life of the city, as he was a director of
the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Suffering from extreme mood swings, at first
Byron turned to brandy. Annabella did not approve. After telling his pregnant
wife, &quot;I must have brandy or a mistress&quot;, he set up an actress for
sympathy and comfort and to satisfy his, no doubt, exotic carnal tastes.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/ada.gif"><img
src="../resources/images/ada-thumb.gif" alt="Ada" align="LEFT" border="0" vspace="0"
hspace="20" width="155" height="187"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Their daughter <a href="../resources/images/ada.gif">Ada</a> was born
in December, eleven months after their wedding. A few weeks later, claiming
that Byron was insane, Annabella took the child home to her parents. Byron
never saw either of them again.</p>
<p align="justify">Lady Caroline Lamb had not relinquished her desire for
Byron, but it had metamorphosed to the &quot;fury of a woman scorned&quot;.
William Lamb, her husband, was Annabella's cousin. After the separation,
Caroline arranged a meeting with her and revealed Byron's secrets &#151; as she
interpreted them &#151; that he had slept with, and possibly impregnated, his
half sister and that, at school and in the East, he had enjoyed homosexual
contact with boys. &quot;Sodomy&quot; was, at the time, a capital crime in
Britain.<br clear="all">
</p>
<p align="justify">This salacious gossip was soon circulating throughout
society. Annabella discovered that by keeping a &quot;policy of silence&quot;,
the rumours re-enforced her position on the moral high ground, even though she
had walked out on her husband. Byron was devastated.</p>
<p align="justify">Alone in his huge and elegant house on Piccadilly Terrace in
London, Byron was visited by a eighteen year old girl who wanted to become his
mistress.</p>
          <p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/claire.gif">Claire Clairmont</a> and her 
            stepsister, <a href="../resources/images/mary.gif">Mary Godwin</a>, had returned 
            from Switzerland where they had eloped with <a href="../resources/images/shelley.gif">Percy 
            Shelley</a>, a married man who was also a poet, but one of little 
            fame. They believed in the &quot;Otaheite&quot; (Tahiti) Philosophy 
            &#151; of free love. As Percy and Mary now had a child, Claire was 
            no longer welcome in their unconventional family. It took persistence 
            and many visits, but Claire finally got her wish &#151; Byron consoled 
            himself with her. Two weeks later he left England forever.</p>
          <p align="justify">Byron travelled through Europe, writing additional verses for 
            Childe Harold, and settled in a villa, Diodati, on the lake near Geneva. 
            Claire was there, waiting for him, with Mary and Shelley. </p>
<p align="justify">Byron, in need of a friend, became very attached to Shelley.
The time they spent together discussing philosophy and poetry, enriched his
craftsmanship. They sailed down the lake together, visiting the romantic
settings in <em>La Nouvelle Heloise</em>, a novel by Rousseau. They did not
take the women with them. One afternoon they exchanged roses.</p>
<p align="justify">After visiting the Chateau of Chillon, Byron was inspired to
write one of his most moving poems: <em>The Prisoner of Chillon</em>. One rainy
night, the group, which included Byron's handsome young personal physician,
<a href="../resources/images/dr-polidori.gif">Dr. Polidori</a>, decided to compose ghost
stories. The result was Mary's <em>Frankenstein</em> and Dr. Polidori's <em>The
Vampyre.</em> This story was published as &quot;a story of Lord Byron's&quot;
which it undoubtedly is, even though he publicly denied it. It concerns a man
named Lord Ruthin who lives in an Abbey and infects his victims with an unholy
sexual need.</p>
<p align="justify">Byron kept Claire busy, letting her copy out his poetry and
bedding her until she revealed that she had become pregnant by him in England.
He agreed to care for the child, but refused to have any more to do with her. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Byron moved to Venice, where he conveniently fell in love
with his landlady. His poetic production there was very rich &#151; completion
of <em>Childe Harold</em>, <em>The Lament of Tasso</em>, <em>Mazeppa</em>,
<em>Manfred</em>, <em>Beppo</em>, and the first parts of his masterpiece,
<em>Don Juan</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">His sexual activity was frenetic and legendary. He kept
several mistresses, his gondolier procured whores, and he rented a
&quot;casino&quot; &#151; a small apartment &#151; for assignations with
actresses, opera stars and countesses, all of whom competed for him and seem to
have been most grateful for his attentions.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="../resources/images/allegra.gif"><img

border="0" vspace="0" hspace="20" width="166" height="197"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Claire brought his daughter, <a
href="../resources/images/allegra.gif">Allegra</a>, to Italy. He welcomed the child, but
he refused to see Claire, allowing only Shelley to visit him.</p>
<p align="justify">One fateful evening in 1819, at a &quot;conversatione&quot;
at Contessa Benzone's palazzo, Byron met a very pretty nineteen year old
contessa, <a href="../resources/images/teresa.gif">Teresa Guiccioli</a>, who delighted in
discussion of poets and poetry. The next few days were spent making ecstatic
love at his casino. He wrote to a friend that she was &quot;lovely as dawn and
warm as noon&quot;. He fell &quot;most painfully&quot; in love with her &#151;
at the age of thirty one.</p>
<p align="justify">When she returned to Ravenna with her elderly husband, she
became ill. Byron was sent for. He arrived to find that she was not expected to
live. He bought poison intending to join her if she died, as so many others he
had loved had done.</p>
<p align="justify">She soon recovered enough to travel to a doctor in Venice,
in company with Byron. They went to his summer palazzo, where they
&quot;adulterated&quot; in uninterrupted luxurious private leisure.</p>
<p align="justify">After her husband arrived in Venice and subjected them to
some fiery scenes, Teresa returned to Ravenna. Byron planned to go back to
England, but his daughter, Allegra, came down with a fever which, as it was
winter, delayed their journey. Teresa became seriously ill again and her family
begged Byron to come to her. Realizing that he loved her, he moved to Ravenna
and became Teresa's &quot;cavaliere servente&quot; &#151; an official lover. He
wrote five verse dramas while living in Count Guiccioli's house and enjoying
the favours of his wife.</p>
<p align="justify">Teresa's brother and father were part of a secret
revolutionary cabal, the Carbonari, attempting to free Italy from the Austrian
Empire. Byron joined them in their intrigues. They were all banished from
Ravenna and, over the next few years, lived in several northern Italian cities.
Their movements were closely watched and reported on by the secret police who
misinterpreted most of their actions and intentions.</p>
          <p align="justify">In Pisa, Byron was reunited with Shelley and Mary. They attracted 
            a group of British writers and hangers-on, a sort of a &quot;court&quot;, 
            that has been called the &quot;Pisan Circle&quot;. Many of them subsequently 
            wrote lucrative memoirs glorifying their time as &quot;friends&quot; 
            of the famous poets.</p>
<p align="justify">Little Allegra, who had been boarding at a convent school,
died of a fever in April 1822. Tragically, a few months later, Shelley and a
friend were drowned while sailing off the coast of Italy. Byron was, once again
devastated by the death of loved ones.</p>
<p align="justify">In Greece, a rebellion had begun against the Turks and a
committee had been organized in England to raise money to support the war.
Byron was elected to the Committee because several of his writings had
expressed sympathy with Greek independence, and he had become a symbol of the
return of Greece to the classic ideal. He went to Cephalonia to supervise the
distribution of the Committee Funds. Unfortunately, they were slow to arrive.
He was, for the first time in his life, rich, as he had finally sold Newstead
Abbey, and had inherited money from his mother-in-law's estate. He was
compelled to use his personal fortune to support the Greek war &#151; until the
funds arrived.</p>
<p align="justify">His emotional life was, as usual, distractingly complex. He
had fallen in love with a fifteen year old Greek boy named Lukas. He knew this
love could not be indulged, but he spoiled the boy with presents, elegant
uniforms and the command of a troop of soldiers</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>'Tis time this heart should be unmoved<br>
Since others it has ceased to move, <br>
Yet though I cannot be beloved<br>
<spacer width="25">Still let me love. <br>
<br>
The hope, the fear, the jealous care<br>
              The exalted portion of the pain <br>
And power of Love I cannot share<br>
<spacer width="25">But wear the chain.<br>
<br>
Tread those reviving passions down<br>
Unworthy manhood; -unto thee <br>
Indifferent should the smile or frown <br>
              <spacer width="25">Of beauty be. <a href="#10"><font
size="-1"><sup>x</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>I watched thee when the foe was at our side -<br>
Ready to strike at him, -or thee and me - <br>
Were safety hopeless - rather than divide<br>
Aught with one loved - save love and liberty.<br>
<br>
I watched thee in the breakers - when the rock<br>
Received our prow - and all was storm and fear, <br>
And bade thee cling to me through every shock -<br>
              This arm would be thy bark - or breast thy bier. <br>
<br>
I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes -<br>
              Yielding my couch - and stretched me on the ground <br>
When overworn with watching - ne'er to rise<br>
From thence - if thou an early grave hadst found. <br>
<br>
The earthquake came and rocked the quivering wall -<br>
And men and Nature reeled as if with wine - <br>
Whom did I seek around the tottering hall -<br>
For thee - whose safety first provide for - thine. <br>
<br>
And when convulsive throes denied my breath<br>
The faintest utterance to my fading thought - <br>
To thee - to thee - even in the grasp of death<br>
My Spirit turned - Ah! oftener than it ought. <br>
<br>
Thus much and more - and yet thou lov'st me not,<br>
And never wilt - Love dwells not in our will - <br>
Nor can I blame thee - though it be my lot<br>
              To strongly - wrongly - vainly - love thee still. <a href="#11"><font
size="-1"><sup>xi</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Byron mortified his flesh with a stringent diet &#151; soda
water and biscuits &#151; which, as he no doubt knew, was the medieval penance
prescribed for homoerotic lust. Unfortunately, a man on a starvation diet could
not withstand the stress of organizing and mediating a war. He succumbed to two
seizures &#151; probably symptoms of anorexia nervosa &#151; that were
diagnosed by his incompetent doctors as brain disease &#151; which would be, in
the nineteenth century medical opinion, the inevitable result of his life of
sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Weakened and ill, he went riding in a rainstorm and came
down with a fever &#151; probably a recurrence of malaria. His doctors wanted
to bleed him, which Byron resisted. If bleeding were efficacious there would be
a lot of healthy people on a battle field. Ultimately he became too weak to
argue. They bled him for two days and were pleased when his veins ran clear.
One of his last lucid remarks, to his valet, was : &quot;My doctors have
assassinated me&quot;. They may very well have done so. As the embodiment of
Romantic rebellion many powerful people wanted Byron dead &#151; the crowned
heads of Europe, the Sultan of Turkey and the Pope. </p>
<p align="justify">On Easter Sunday, 1824, at the age of thirty six, Byron
died, during a suitably ferocious thunder storm.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p>When Time, or soon or late, shall bring<br>
The dreamless sleep that lulls the dead<br>
Oblivion! may thy languid wing<br>
Wave gently o'er my dying bed<br>
<br>
No band of friends or heirs be there<br>
To weep or wish the coming blow:<br>
No maiden with dishevelled hair<br>
To feel, or feign, decorous woe<br>
<br>
But silent let me sink to earth,<br>
With no officious mourners near:<br>
I would not mar one hour of mirth,<br>
Nor startle friendship with a tear. <a href="#12"><font
size="-1"><sup>xii</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
          <p align="justify">He did not get this wish. He was surrounded to the 
            last by a babble of weeping servants, helpless body guards and horrified 
            supplicants.</p>
<p align="justify">He was immediately autopsied and the doctors found what they
were looking for &#151; the brain lesions that they believed resulted from his
sexual promiscuity. This provided the evidence they needed for the necessity of
having bled him &#151; which probably killed him. Malaria attacks the red blood
cells.</p>
<p align="justify">His lungs were left in Greece, but contrary to his wishes,
the rest of him was pickled in spirits and shipped back to England. Westminster
Abbey refused to conduct his funeral because he was an unrepentant sinner.
Finally, a long cortege followed his funeral carriage north to his internment
&#151; next to his mother &#151; among generations of Byrons.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<blockquote> <p> When, to their airy hall my fathers' voice<br>
Shall call my spirit, joyful in their choice<br>
When poised upon the gale, my form shall ride,<br>
Or dark, in mist, descend the mountain's side<br>
Oh! may my shade behold no sculptured urns,<br>
To mark the spot where earth to earth returns!<br>
No lengthened scroll, no praise&#151;encumber'd stone<br>
My epitaph shall be my name alone:<br>
If <u>that</u> with honour fail to crown my clay<br>
Oh! may no other fame my deeds repay!<br>
<u>That</u> only <u>that</u>, shall single out the spot;<br>
By that remembered or by that forgot. <a href="#13"><font
size="-1"><sup>xiii</sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">This wish, written in 1803, at the age of fifteen, was
granted. He is in the crypt under the choir stall of the parish church of St.
Mary Magdalen at Hucknall Torkard, appropriately dedicated to an adulterous
woman &#151; who was forgiven. It is covered by a plaque presented by the King
of Greece, which carries only his name &#151; and a hero's laurel wreath.</p>
