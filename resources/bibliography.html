              <p>Scrope Davies, Charles Matthews and John Cam Hobhouse were Byron's 
                closest college friends. They took part in the wild house party 
                that had established Byron's reputation as a living embodim ent 
                of the Gothic ideal - a young and handsome Lord living in a decaying 
                Abbey who drank copiously from a silver cup made from the skull 
                of a dead monk followed by sexual orgies with an in-house set 
                of sex-slave servants. They had dressed up as monks for these 
                festivities. This behaviour was patterned on the reputation of 
                the infamous Hell Fire Club of fifty years before. It was a sort 
                of elaborate Halloween party.</p>
              <p>Scrope was a professional gambler, but ultimately he lost everything 
                and escaped jail by moving to Belgium. Before leaving he left 
                a trunk full of papers, many of which were from or about Byron, 
                with their mutual friend Douglas Kinnaird, a banker. The trunk 
                was found in the bank's vaults in the 1970's and opened to great 
                excitement. It contained, among other things, original manuscripts 
                of Byron's and Shelley's that Scrope had brought back from Switzerland 
                in 1816.</p>
              <p>His name is pronounced in a way to make sense of a joke of Byron's 
                that he should marry and raise some scruples.</p>
              <p>He was a good friend of Beau Brummell, and the other Dandies. 
                He and Byron often ate together at a famous Dandy club, the Cocoa 
                Tree.</p>
              <p>This book has some great cartoons about Byron that came out in 
                the British press at the time of the discovery of the trunk.</p>

              <p><strong>(read this to get a better understanding of what went 
                so horribly wrong)</strong></p>
              <p>Elwin's book is a scholarly examination of documents known as 
                the Wentworth Papers held by Lord Byron's family until the 1990's, 
                which are the journals and personal correspondence that Lady Byron 
                kept before, during and after her short and tortured marriage 
                to the poet. For the forty years that remained of her life she 
                obsessively continued to write explanations and increasingly inaccurate 
                self-absorbed and self-absolving recollections of her actions 
                and motivations during their relationship. She is the source of 
                the much of the evidence of Byron's incestuous love affair with 
                his half sister, Augusta Byron Leigh. </p>
              <p>Malcolm Elwin had considerable difficulty retaining an academic 
                distance from this material and his distaste for Annabella Milbanke 
                Byron's manipulations of her facts and her family come through 
                clearly.</p>

            <dd> 
              <p>This is a peculiar book which begins with discussion of the relationship 
                between Byron and William Hazlitt, two men who never met. Foot 
                is an eminent British politician, Labour member for Blaenau Gwent 
                from &quot;time immemorial&quot;, as the Welsh would say. He discusses 
                Byron's passionate liberalism which is illogical, to say the least, 
                for a nobleman of the highest status. It was, of course, fashionable 
                to be Whig if young and literary in 1808, but Byron's hatred of 
                &quot;tyranny&quot; (at the core of his being) was far more than 
                a fashionable pose. He must have learned it &quot;at his mother's 
                knee&quot;, as his father's family were traditionally Royalists 
                and too self-involved and foolish to have much care for or interest 
                in social justice.</p>

              <p>It is very helpful to be able to read the other side of Byron's 
                conversations on paper. This book has many of the letters sent 
                to Byron by John Cam Hobhouse, from the first in about 1808 (which 
                is friendly, but formal) to the last, sent in March 1824, which 
                Byron probably never read because he died in mid April. The chronicle 
                of an exceptional friendship.</p>

              <p><strong>(avoid this book)</strong></p>
              <p>The best written(and most accurate) part of this book is the 
                blurb on the inner fold of the dust jacket - a nice, neat biography. 
                The book itself is riddled with inaccuracies, has laughably poor 
                illustrations (which make Lady Byron look like a moron and Percy 
                Shelley like a ghoul) and tries to make a sad and foolish figure 
                of a fascinating character of literary history whose life was 
                theatrically tragic. I believe this is the outcome of accepting 
                as valid sources the writings of friends, foes and family members 
                of Byron who made a cottage industry in the late 19th and early 
                20th centuries out of mean and gossip laden, self-aggrandizing 
                books elaborating a sometimes very limited association with the 
                famous poet. </p>
              <p><cite>Byron: the Flawed Angel</cite> is, in itself, seriously 
                flawed - by the writer's avoidance of direct discussion of Byron's 
                sexuality - his childhood abuse by a nurse, his youthful homosexual 
                desire and his frenetic &quot;carnal recreation&quot; (to use 
                his phrase)as an adult. His life, letters, journals and poetry 
                are a mirror of these sensual, emotional and sexual struggles 
                which deserve honest and serious study in a popular biography 
                published in the late 20th Century.</p>
              <p>On the dust jacket flap it says:</p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p><cite>Nearly forty years have elapsed since the last full-scale 
                  biography of one of the greatest and most entertaining poets 
                  of any age, and a reappraisal (using significant new material) 
                  is overdue</cite></p>

            <dt>Guiccioli, Countess Teresa. <strong><cite>My Recollections of 
              Lord Byron and Those of Eye Witnesses of His Life</cite></strong>(translated 
              from the French &quot;Lord Byron juge par les temions de sa Vie&quot;, 
              by Hubert E.H. Jerningham). Harper Bros, New York: 1869</dt>
            <dd> 
              <p>This book is available in old libraries and through used booksellers 
                on-line. Be careful!!! as she was about 60 years old by the time 
                it was written and trying to sanitize Byron's reputation (and 
                hers as well, of course). By the 1860's the moral climate had 
                changed dramatically from the more open and morally indulgent 
                1820's. Interestingly to the scholar, before writing the book, 
                she had access to Moore's interviews of Byron's friends, was a 
                friend of Marguerite, Lady Blessington and must have read many 
                of the letters to Byron that have not yet been published. However, 
                it is clear that she has significantly altered the tone and implications 
                of some of those that have been published. Her statements of Byron's 
                saintly characteristics should be treated with considerable scepticism. 
                On the other hand, she is evidently still passionately in love 
                with him forty years after his death and misses him greatly.</p>

              Frances Wilson. London: Dent, 1995</dt>
            <dd> 
              <p>This is a recent republishing of the book that Byron said, if 
                it pretended to be a portrait of him, could not be a very good 
                likeness as he had not sat long enough for it. He also characterized 
                it as in poor taste since kiss and tell was rightly condemned 
                by most women but Caroline had &quot;f**ked and published&quot;. 
                There is a stuffy analysis of Caroline as a feminist literary 
                heroine expressing forbidden female lust, but I am more intrigued 
                by the stylishness of her writing - purple prose, but appropriate 
                in the context. She mixes Byron (Glenarvon)up with Celtic legend, 
                implausible Gothic plot twists and a recent rebellion in Ireland. 
                There may be answers to some Byronic puzzles buried here, but 
                they are completely muddled up with the outright nonsense. He 
                seems to have realized this but been worried in any case. Caroline 
                knew far too much about him and was evidently unstable. It was 
                Caroline who was &quot;bad, mad and dangerous to know&quot; not 
                Byron. By the way, it was Caroline's friend Lady Morgan who reported 
                that Caroline had told her that she had written that famous quote 
                about Byron in her diary. This is far from a reliable source.</p>

                sure he was still there. &quot; Lord Byron's body was in an excellent 
                state of preservation. The hair on his head, body and limbs was 
                intact, though grey. His sexual organ shewed quite abnormal development.&quot;

                relationship with the Countess Teresa Gamba Guiccioli as told 
                in their letters to one another and from the dedicated research 
                of another superlative literary detective, Iris Origo, who wrote 
                in the introduction: &quot;on her deathbed in Italy in 1873, [Teresa] 
                is said to have expressed to her sister-in-law . . . 'The more 
                Byron is known, . . . the better he will be loved.'&quot;</p>
              <p>The story of Byron and Teresa would be the stuff of legend even

              <p>This book is almost impossible to find. &quot;George Paston&quot; 
                is the name assumed in the 1930's by a lady writer, Miss E.M. 
                Symonds, so that she could publish her research on the erotic 
                works and life of the infamous Regency poet. Peter Quennell, who 
                went on to write many more books about Byron, completed it after 
                her death.</p>
              <p>The book is a small selection from the collection of amazing 
                mash letters written to the celebrated, handsome but melancholy 
                young poet, Lord Byron, by hundreds of Regency groupies who wanted 
                a chance to ease his pain &quot;up close and personal&quot;. The 
                letters were kept by Byron in tin boxes and ended up at his publisher's 
                at 50 Albemarle Street. They survived the bombing in the Second 
                World War and are still there.</p>
              <p>The letters are hilarious, touching and tragic. It is important 
                to remember that they are not fiction - that real people wrote, 
                cried over and read them. I have a treasured copy.</p>
